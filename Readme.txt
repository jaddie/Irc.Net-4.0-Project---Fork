Implementation
==============

This library represents an complete implementation of the IRC client protocol,
primarily as described in RFC 2812 <http://irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc2812.txt>.
It additonally contains functionality that is in common use by modern IRC
servers (as of December 2009), detailed as follows.

Non-RFC Features
----------------

 * Parsing of ISUPPORT parameters (draft specification at
   <http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03.txt>).
   Interpretation of such parameters is left to the user.
 
 * CTCP (Client-To-Client Protocol) support (specification at
   <http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html>).
